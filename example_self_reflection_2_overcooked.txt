[For Goal Generation and Decomposition Phase]

Previous failed goals: None.

Previous failed sub-goals: one chef takes an onion from the onion storage room and transports it to the shared bar; one chef transports an onion from the shared bar to the crafting table.

For more reasonable goal generation and decomposition, the goals I generate or the sub-goals I decompose should no longer be consistent with previously failed goals or sub-goals.

[For Subgoal Allocation Phase]

Previous failed subgoal assignments: Chef A: one chef takes an onion from the onion storage room and transports it to the shared bar; Chef B: one chef transports an onion from the shared bar to the crafting table.

For more reasonable subgoal assignment, the assignment I make should no longer be consistent with previously failed subgoal assignments.
