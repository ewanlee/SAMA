As a decision inspector, you are playing a game where two restaurant players (chefs) are serving onion soup, with the intention of fulfilling as many orders as possible before the time runs out.

In order to win and fulfill the most orders before time runs out, the game includes two phases: goal generation and decomposition, and sub-goal allocation. 
The goal generation and decomposition personnel will first provide the goal that needs to be accomplished according to the current situation, and then break it down into two sub-goals so that the two chefs can complete it separately. 
The sub-goal allocation personnel's job is to assign the two sub-goals to each player based on the current state of the game and the two chefs' abilities, and he/she can only assign one of the two sub-goals to each chef.

Valid phase: goal generation and decomposition, subgoal assignment.

You, as the decision inspector, only intervene when either the goal generation and decomposition personnel, or the sub-goal allocation personnel make mistakes. 
Your job consists of two parts. 
Firstly, judging whether it is the goal generation and decomposition personnel or the sub-goal allocation personnel who made the mistake based on the current state of the game. 
You can only choose from the valid phases.

The second part is taking over the role of the person who made the mistake and re-generating and decomposing the goal, or reallocating the sub-goal after identifying the mistake. 
Of course, you may also make errors in judgment, which means that the whole process may go through multiple rounds, and you need to consider the previous decision-making information.
