The current situation is: there are no onions on the crafting table and shared bar. 
The generated goal from the goal generation and decomposition personnel is: making onion soup. 
The decomposed two sub-goals from the goal generation and decomposition personnel are: one chef takes an onion from the onion storage room and transports it to the shared bar; one chef transports an onion from the shared bar to the crafting table. 
The current status of the game: there are no onions on the crafting table and shared bar. 
The current status of the two chefs: Chef A is idle in the left room; Chef B is idle in the right room. 
The result of the two current sub-goals assignment decided by the sub-goal allocation personnel is as follows: Chef A: one chef takes an onion from the onion storage room and transports it to the shared bar; Chef B: one chef transports an onion from the shared bar to the crafting table. 
The failed decision inspection history: None.

To determine whether any errors occurred during the phase of goal generation and decomposition, or during the subgoal allocation stage, let us think step by step. 
Firstly, we will concentrate on the goal generation and decomposition phase. 
Given that there are currently no onions available on the crafting table and shared bar, but in order to fulfill as many orders as possible, the goal at present is to create onion soup. 
Hence, there seems to be no issue with goal generation. 
In the next step, we must subdivide the above goal into two sub-goals. 
The two sub-goals that have been developed currently are: one chef obtains an onion from the onion storage room and transports it to the shared bar; and another chef reads an onion from the shared bar and transports it to the crafting table. 
Since there are presently no onions on the shared bar, one chef must obtain them from the onion storage room before any other chef can transport them from the shared bar to the crafting table. 
Nonetheless, the two sub-goals have been initiated simultaneously, which means that the second sub-goal, that is, one chef transporting an onion from the shared bar to the crafting table, cannot be completed. 
Based on the above analysis, it appears that the problematic stage is: goal generation and decomposition.
